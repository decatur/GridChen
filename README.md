# About
Very lightweight and fast editable web grid with strict MS-Excel adherence to user experience.
Very modern (web components, es6 modules) with **no** dependencies.

If you need to edit mixed hierarchical and grid data, please visit sister project https://decatur.github.io/form-chen.

# Demos

See https://decatur.github.io/grid-chen

# Usage

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>
<grid-chen></grid-chen>
</body>
<script type="module">
    import "./grid-chen/component.js"
    import {createView} from "./grid-chen/matrixview.js"

                {title: 'SomeNumber', type: 'number'}
            ]
        }
    };
    const rows = [['2019-01-01', 1], ['2020-01-01', 2], ['2021-01-01', 3]];
    document.querySelector('grid-chen').resetFromView(createView(schema, rows));
</script>
```

# Issues

* onselectionchanged fires too often
* Paste must select pasted region (pasted region differs from selection if selection cannot be tiled by source); easy
* Type violation of cell value must align left; easy

# TODOs

* Fix module test_Clipboard
* Improve encapsulation of JavaScript API 
* Show 1 empty row at end (Slider issue)
* Avoid refreshing complete viewport on cell change
* Handling of Infinity and NaN (#NV in de-de)

# Alternatives
* [SlickGrid](https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid)
* [ag-Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/)
* [canvas-datagrid](https://github.com/TonyGermaneri/canvas-datagrid)
* [fin-hypergrid](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/core)

# Expected Behaviour

We try to mimic MS-Excel as close as possible.

## Light / Dark Mode

grid-chen has a light and dark mode. 
The desired mode is sniffed through the background color intensity of the body element.
There are currently no other explicit CSS hooks, such as CSS custom properties.

âš  Some dark reader (for example <a href="https://darkreader.org">Dark Reader</a>) extensions may show inferior
results when converting light to dark mode than grid-chen's native dark mode.
